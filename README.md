Here’s a ready-to-run Ansible playbook that uses Konvoy Image Builder (KIB) to produce a vSphere image for Nutanix NKP based on Rocky Linux 9.1. It also includes an optional step (tagged base_os) to build the base OS vSphere template first, using D2iQ’s vSphere base-template tooling—useful if you don’t already have a Rocky 9.1 base template in vCenter.

KIB expects a vSphere base OS template to exist, then it builds the final DKP/NKP image from that via an image.yaml. The image.yaml fields and the konvoy-image build vsphere ... flow come straight from the DKP docs, and the Rocky 9.1 variant is officially documented.
